    <blockquote class="quote">
      "I just want everyone to have clean water like I do." – Rachel Beckwith
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      When 9-year-old Rachel Beckwith gave up birthday gifts to raise $300 for clean water, she never imagined what would happen next.
      After her sudden passing, her story inspired people around the world to donate in her honor—raising over 
      <strong class="highlight">$1.2 million</strong>.
      Thanks to Rachel’s selfless act, <strong class="highlight">37,000+ people</strong> in Ethiopia now have access to clean, safe drinking water.
